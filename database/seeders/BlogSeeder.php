          <p><s>Having just watched the <em>Imitation Game</em> (yes, I am</s> clearly a couple of years off the pace when it comes to my cinema-viewing habits), I was struck by the sheer force of genius that is Alan Turing. Here is a mathematician who, with a handpicked team, set about building a device that could break the coded messages created by the German&#39;s Enigma machine during WW2. That machine has led Turing to be described as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. In a world where Google and Apple dominate our landscape, it is hard not to underestimate Turing&rsquo;s place in the pantheon of innovative minds.</p>
          
          <p>While watching the film, I was also struck by the level of resistance that Turing faced from those around him. The scale of Turing&rsquo;s vision &ndash; to create one single machine to crack every code, rather than deciphering each batch of messages on a daily basis &ndash; left his colleagues frustrated initially by the slow progress they were making. In a war when quick wins were so appealing, Turing&rsquo;s commitment to the long game, despite intense pressure from his Naval bosses and his own code-breaking colleagues, is a telling lesson in patience and persistence.</p>
          
          <p>The long (or not-so-long) game also came up in conversation with the Royal National Institute of Blind People&rsquo;s acting chief executive, Sally Harvey, when I asked which projects the RNIB is working on to improve the lives of people living with sight loss.</p>
          
          <p>Her answer? &ldquo;Driverless cars. The RNIB is involved in a number of projects that are going on around this, and we share in the excitement of the potential. It is coming sooner than probably any of us would realise.&rdquo;</p>
          
          <p>Look out for <em>OT&rsquo;</em>s full-length interview with Ms Harvey in the February edition.</p>

          <p>The importance of elderly patients&rsquo; vision has once again been highlighted, after the release of a new study examining the impact of visual impairment on physical and mental health.</p>
          
          <p>German researchers followed nearly 2400 people aged between 77 and 101 for a decade, tracking their vision, wider health, intellectual functioning, hobbies and physical and social activities. Study participants were interviewed every 18 months, according to the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.14458/full" target="_blank">paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</em>.</p>
          
          <p>The scientists found that the onset of severe visual impairment led to a drop off in the physical and mental activities that a person undertook. Critically, this coincided with a significant drop in a person&rsquo;s physical health, as well as a steep decline in their intellectual capacity.</p>
          
          <p>These findings reiterate the importance of visual function to the health of both an individual and a wider population, the authors explained.</p>
          
          <p>&ldquo;Interventional strategies to postpone visual impairment might contribute to maintaining physical and cognitive function in old age. This should be emphasised because approximately three-quarters of vision loss is avoidable, and many eye care interventions are cost effective,&rdquo; the researchers concluded.</p>', 'image_path' => '/media/files/industry_news/e84a76b7ce05f7ac0a41307dbb9f3c63_images.jpg', 'user_acl_role_id' => null, 'blog_category_id' => '1', 'status' => '0', 'created_at' => '2017-07-20 16:15:18', 'metatitle' => 'Losing more than sight | Locumkit', 'metadescription' => 'The importance of elderly patientsâ€™ vision has once again been highlighted, after the release of a new study examining the impact of visual impairment on physical and mental health.', 'metakeywords' => 'Locumkit'),

          <p>Key members of the optical profession met at a College of Optometrists roundtable event to determine the best way to prepare for the changes set to hit optometrists and dispensing opticians in the coming years.</p>
          
          <p>AOP chief executive, Henrietta Alderman, board chair, Kevin Thompson, and legal team clinical adviser, Trevor Warburton, attended the September event to represent the Association.</p>
          
          <p>The roundtable followed the release of The Foresight Project report and the College&rsquo;s Optical Workforce Survey (OWS) results.</p>
          
          <p>The meeting focused on the challenges of new technology and automation, myopia control developments, telehealth, deregulation, data sharing, community eye care demands, scope of practice extensions, changing demographics, an uneven geographical supply of professionals and a rise in part-time and locum working arrangements.</p>
          
          <p>Six priority actions that optical bodies could undertake together were determined. Data sharing led the list, with the roundtable supporting the continued push for IT connectivity in England by the College and the Optical Confederation.</p>
          
          <p>The OWS data indicating a gender pay gap was also highlighted, and the group suggested that this needed to be examined in more detail, work already being undertaken by the College and the AOP.</p>
          
          <p>The roundtable participants also recommended that the sector should plan for changes in business models, prepare practitioners for the expected changes and examine the requirements for future regulation and governance.</p>
          
          <p>An education review was also added to the action list, though the General Optical Council&rsquo;s work in this area was noted.</p>
          
          <p>In their discussions, the group raised the need for a prescribing qualification that is &ldquo;less onerous&rdquo; than independent prescribing, with a modified additional supply qualification suggested.</p>
          
          <p>Ms Alderman told OT that: &ldquo;The AOP welcomes the efforts of the College of Optometrists in bringing this event together and for producing a helpful report on the key focus points of the day. Some very pertinent discussions took place, such as the future impact of technology, review of educational training and the expanding optometry remit &ndash; all of which remain at the fore of the AOP&rsquo;s work in 2017.</p>
          
          <p>&ldquo;Significant changes lie ahead within the profession and we are supportive of this pragmatic approach to work collaboratively on some of the major issues facing the sector,&rdquo; she concluded.</p>

      array('title' => 'Is cash earned by my company my money whilst trading as a locum Optometrists or locum Dispensing Optician?', 'slug' => 'withdrawing-money', 'description' => '<p>So you have set up your limited company and are busy locuming as an Optometrist or Dispensing Optician. Your earning good money and you notice that your cash figure is building up. You decide to treat yourself and decide to buy a new car, go on a holiday, etc. You might think that you&rsquo;re free to dip into the company&rsquo;s profits as you see fit; after all it is your company. However it is NOT, and this misunderstanding can land you in a lot of trouble.</p>
          
          <p>Limited companies are a legal entity in their own right, which basically means that the company&rsquo;s assets and profits belong to the company, not you, the business owner. It is this differentiation which enforced HMRC to stop you simply taking money out of the business like a sole trader, whose personal and business assets are one and the same.</p>
          
          <p>Does it mean you can not take money out of the company? Yes you can, it can only be taken out of a limited company in one of three ways:</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>1. Director&rsquo;s salary, expenses and benefits</strong></p>
          
          <p>The most familiar method of taking money out of a limited company is for you to pay yourself a salary. You would have to register with HMRC for PAYE and will also have to pay National Insurance Contributions on your earnings.&nbsp; Even if the only employee is you as a Director, you still have to register as an Employer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Most company directors choose to take a very small salary, up to the National Insurance Contributions threshold of &pound;8,060, and instead take the lion&rsquo;s share of their pay in dividends.</p>
          
          <p>At this level of pay you qualify for the state pension and benefit entitlements, but do not incur a personal tax liability.</p>
          
          <p>You will be responsible for paying any Tax and National Insurance contributions to HMRC, and will need to ensure that a Full Payment submission is sent to HMRC after each pay-run.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>2. Directors loan</strong></p>
          
          <p>A director&rsquo;s loan is another efficient way to take money out of a company, although it can be fraught with hazards if the process is not handled correctly. If you take money out of a business and it is not a salary or a dividend, you have what is known as a director&rsquo;s loan.</p>
          
          <p>All transactions in a director&rsquo;s loan account have to be accounted for in the company&rsquo;s balance sheet, and may also have to be included in the company tax return and the director&rsquo;s self-assessment return. In most cases, directors with overdrawn loan accounts will not have to pay any tax as long as the sum is repaid within nine months and one day of the company&rsquo;s account reference date. If a director&rsquo;s loan account is overdrawn by more than &pound;10,000, the sum will have to be declared on the director&rsquo;s self-assessment tax return, and the appropriate rate of tax will apply.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>3. Dividends</strong></p>
          
          <p>Note: you can only pay yourself dividends if you have profits remaining in the company after paying all your corporation tax.</p>
          
          <p>Majority of locum Optometrist or locum Dispensing Opticians would be expected to have distributable profits (assuming you have not invested heavily on equipment, car, etc.). In this case, income can be taken out of the company in the form of dividends. This is an incredibly tax efficient method of taking a payment as there is no personal tax liability on net dividends up to &pound;30,892.50. Even payments above this level will attract a more favourable tax rate than if the money were taken as a salary.</p>
          
          <p>To enable a dividend to be paid a director&rsquo;s meeting must be held to declare the dividend, with the minutes of the meeting being kept for future reference. This is the case even if there is only one director (as is the case with most locum Optometrists), and is often overlooked by companies with a sole director and shareholder.</p>
          
          <p>A dividend voucher must also be prepared for any dividends paid which should include the date, company name, name of the shareholder being paid the dividend and the amount. A copy of the voucher must be given to the shareholder receiving the dividend, with a copy being retained by the company.</p>
          
          <p>It is important to note that tax may be due on dividend receipts in excess of the dividend allowance which is currently &pound;2,000.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Dividends must also be declared by the individuals as part of their self-assessment tax returns</p>
          
          <p><strong>Key messages</strong></p>
          
          <p>Profit and subsequent cash earned by your limited company is not disposable cash for you as a locum Optometrist or locum Dispensing Optician to spend for personal expenditure.</p>
          
          <p>If you did want to spend the money earned by you by your company, you would have to withdraw the cash from the company by the form of a salary, loan or dividend.</p>
          
          <p>The careful use of a combination of these methods can be an extremely tax efficient way to minimise tax liabilities. This is due to the fact that corporation tax is payable at just 20 percent, while income tax on earnings over &pound;42,385 (with the &pound;10,600 personal allowance) sits at 40 percent.</p>

          With all the sad news we are facing at the moment, there is some good news for the self employed - the controversial IR35 tax reforms have been delayed for a year. A welcome piece of news for locums and employers who use locums. 
          
          Speaking in the House of Commons Budget debate tonight Chief Treasury Secretary Steve Barclay said:
          
          &quot;This is a deferral in response to the ongoing spread of Covid-19 to help businesses and individuals. This is a deferral, not a cancellation, and the government remains committed to re-introducing this policy.&quot;</pre>
          
          <pre>
          The AOP has also recently released a newsletter updating all its members on the delay of IR35 and advised locums to discuss with their employers, if they had a change in contract in anticipation of IR35.
          
          Please do note this means that the employer is no longer required to assess your employment status but you as a locum are still required to assess your own status. HMRC can ask you to pay additional tax for previous periods, if they deem you to be a &#39;pseudo employee&#39;.

          <p><span style="font-size:16px">It has been reported that alone, the deferral of VAT is costing the HMRC approximately &pound;14bn a month in revenue.</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:16px">As part of the many schemes to help individuals and businesses with cash flow, one of these was the option to defer your VAT payments up to June 2020. To do this users were advised to cancel their DD.</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:16px">If you are one of those who did or could not cancel their DD in time and maybe now want to take advantage of this scheme then HMRC has announced that you can claim a refund for the VAT payment you made.</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:16px">To do this you can either:</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:16px">1) Submit a DD Indemnity Claim with your bank, stating that you want to claim a refund under the Direct Debit Indemnity Scheme (DDI). HMRC confirms that there is no time limit in making this request.</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:16px">2) Alternatively you can request for a repayment directly from HMRC rather than the bank, however this is a slower process (up to 21 days).</span></p>

          <p>As mentioned in our previous articles/briefings, this grant is for locums who are trading as sole traders. If you are an employer who has staff furloughed or are an &lsquo;owner managed business&rsquo; furloughed director, then please <a href="/blog/cjrsround2">click here</a> to see the updates on the furlough scheme, also released on 12th June 2020.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>The second phase of the SEIS grant will be open to applicants from August 2020. Again, you do not have to do anything, as HMRC will invite you to apply. The grant this time will be capped at 70% (not 80%) of your average monthly trading profits, hence a maximum of &pound;6,570 can be claimed. This grant will be taxed as normal.</p>
          
          <p><strong>The key thing to note from this new update is that your trade needs to have been adversely affected on or after 14 July. </strong>Why the 14th July? We do not know.</p>
          
          <p>Now as we move into the amber position, which I think means we can start to test private patients if they want an eye test, is there a possibility that locum work will be more into in normal full flow by 14th July and hence trade is not adversely effected. Something to consider? HMRC do state that if you have been affected, but things are likely to pick up, then you can only claim under round 1 (the latest by which you can claim for that is 13th July, if not already claimed).</p>
          
          <p>From first read of the new criteria regarding the 14th July date, it now seems like if your income has been reduced in the 6 weeks from 1 June 2020 to 13 July 2020, but post 14th July things have picked up, then you may have no entitlement to round 2 of the SEIS grant.</p>
          
          <p>HMRC have provided an illustration to demonstrate what they mean by &ldquo;adversely affected&rdquo;. In their example they use the case of a builder, however we can easily replace them to be locum Optometrist or Dispensing Optician, as we locums also work on short term contracts (day contracts) and due to lockdown had little to no work from March to mid-June. We are now starting to see an increase in potential locum work as a result of Opticians opening again for routine eye tests (private only at the time of writing this article). To view the example provided by HMRC, please <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-different-circumstances-affect-the-self-employment-income-support-scheme#adversely-affected-examples">click here</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Unfortunately, there is no further information given provided in on this regard, such as a quantum on the condition &lsquo;adversely affected&rsquo;. We know from round 1 SEIS grant that, to be &lsquo;adversely affected&rsquo; it could be for any amount and for any part of the period, even if it was for only one month out of the three.</p>
          
          <p>HMRC gives the following examples of how a business could be adversely affected by COVID-19:</p>
          
          <p>1) You&rsquo;re unable to work because you:</p>
          
          <p>- are shielding themselves or someone else in their household</p>
          
          <p>- are self-isolating</p>
          
          <p>- are on sick leave because of coronavirus</p>
          
          <p>- have caring responsibilities because of coronavirus</p>
          
          <p>2) You&rsquo;ve had to scale down or temporarily stop trading because:</p>
          
          <p>- your supply chain has been interrupted</p>
          
          <p>- you have fewer or no customers or clients</p>
          
          <p>- your staff are unable to come in to work</p>
          
          <p><strong><span style="color:#000080">- you have fewer or no custmers or clients (I think its fair to say our rates have took a hit and this is what we are being told is the reason for it, so then we should be able to claim on this basis alone)</span></strong></p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>So for locums who do plan to start working again and might notice that despite working again they are earning half of what they earned in the same period last year can still find themselves being ineligible for the round 2 of the SEIS grant. It seems like the criteria is based on on whether or not you are actually able to go back to work or not. Does it extend to mean that only those who still have their place of work closed ot those who have to self -isolate can qualify for the round 2? We are trying to find out.</p>
          
          <p>A common question we get asked by Optometrists or Dispensing Opticians is how will HMRC know? We ourselves do not know this but we do know when claiming for round 2 SEIS grant, they wont do any due diligience but just get you to declare that you were adversely affected. They will most likely carry out their investigation when you file your next year tax returns. If you guys are following our social media platforms you must have noticed the article we posted where Rishi Sunak has decided to give HMRC draconian powers to reclaim hundreds of millions in Coivd19 support payments. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>We at Locumkit will follow up on this and get back to you de-mystifying with further clarification on the vague guidance provided to date, as and when HMRC release more detail. matter. We shall will also keep an eye on how the situation develops changes in the locum market, to determine see how it can potentially interact interacts with round 2 of the SEIS claim.</p>
          
          <p>For those locum Optometirsts or Dispensing Opticians who have taken on the NHS Clinical Contact Caseworker job, any income from there shall not have an impact on round 2 SEIS grant, as it is deemed an entirely a completely different occupation. &nbsp;</p>

          <p>As mentioned in our previous articles/briefings, this grant is for employers who have staff on furlough or &lsquo;owner managed business&rsquo; directors who have furloughed themselves. For locums trading as sole traders, please <a href="/blog/seisround2">click here</a> to see the updates for the SEIS grant for round 2, also updated on 12th June 2020.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>We know that from 1st July, &lsquo;Flexible Furloughing&rsquo; comes into play. This means you can bring back in your staff &lsquo;part-time&rsquo; and pay them for that period only that they are in &lsquo;working&rsquo;. The other &lsquo;non-working&rsquo; period is paid by the government under the furlough scheme, as was in round 1. This is to help support businesses in the &lsquo;re-opening&rsquo; transition period to opening up again.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Other key points from the updates to note are:</p>
          
          <p>- Minimum claim period is 7 calendar days from July onwards: Changes to working hours must cover a period of at least a week.</p>
          
          <p>-&nbsp; There is no minimum time that you must furlough staff for nor is there a minimum or maximum hours that they must work.</p>
          
          <p>- Extra information/clarification on how &lsquo;holiday pay&rsquo; works whilst being furloughed</p>
          
          <p>- A hard deadline of 31 July for submission of all furlough claims, where the occurrence of furlough took place in round 1 (i.e. pre 30 June)</p>
          
          <p>- Employees shielding and/or with caring responsibilities, can still be furloughed provided they have already at least once been furloughed in round 1 (i.e. furloughed pre 30 June)</p>
          
          <p>- Normal redundancy rules apply to furloughed employees - You cannot use CJRS grants to substitute redundancy payments. HMRC have outlined they will continue to monitor the business after the scheme has closed.</p>
          
          <p>- Updated HMRC calculator to be published soon to facilitate with calculation of flexible working.</p>
          
          <p>- New flexi furlough requires a new agreement between employer and employee: Changes must be confirmed to your employee in writing.</p>
          
          <p>- Total number of employees cannot be higher than on any previous claims</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>HMRC have also updated their walk through examples on how to calculate furlough claim for flexible work. Undoubtedly, if this is what you are going to do, it will result in more claims and more work. In addition with flexible work, claims can only be made once you know the hours worked, unlike in stage 1 where you could submit 2 weeks prior.</p>

          <p>In addition to the above, the following information, which we have already communicated to you still holds:</p>
          
          <p>- From August: employers will have to pay towards their employees national insurance and pension contributions. Gov contribution remains at 80%-</p>
          
          <p>- From September: In addition to what is mentioned for Aug, government contribution drops to 70%</p>
          
          <p>- From October: In addition to what is mentioned for Aug, government contribution drops to 60%</p>

          <p>The CJRS is scheduled to close on 31 October - it is then when employers have to decide whether their employees can return to their normal hours or will they need to readjust their contracts or even terminate it.</p>

          <p>Optometrists including locum Optometrists, who provide General Ophthalmic Services (GOS) services in England and Wales can also apply for a CET grant. Currently this is not applicable for Dispensing Opticians or Contact Lens Opticians and ABDO has raised concerns about this but to no avail. Watch this space as we being some news exciting news regarding to application for CET grants for locums.</p>
          
          <p>This allowance is always claimed in arrears for the previous year. We advise all Optometrists (including locum Optometrist) who have carried out GOS tests last year to apply for this taxable grant.</p>
          
          <p>The GOC were looking to make changes to the CET system for the existing cycle with 2019 being a transition year, however this was postponed. All Optometrists, Dispensing Opticians and Contact Lens Opticians should have received an email from the GOC inviting you to provide suggestions to changes to the CET scheme (to make it more flexible and relevant to your career growth). The consultation is open until 20 August. The consultation can be found on the GOC&#39;s online consultation hub by clicking <a href="https://consultation.optical.org/standards-and-cet/cetreview/">here</a>.</p>

      array('title' => 'Summer Economic Update', 'slug' => 'seu-for-locum-optometrist', 'description' => '<p>Yesterday the Chancellor gave his Summer Economic Update (phase two of a three phase plan to tackle COVID-19), which as anticipated was focused on helping the economy bounce back and help save/drive new jobs, especially in light of the phasing out of financial support (CJRS &amp; SEIS).</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>There was unfortunately nothing in yesterday&rsquo;s announcement that was specifically targeted towards sole traders (locum Optometrists or Dispensing Opticians). No announcement of any extension to the support scheme for self-employed or even any consideration for the already excluded individuals.</p>
          
          <p>Our economy is built on low unemployment rates and it is therefore paramount that the Chancellor does everything in his remit to ensure he can limit mass unemployment.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>At the moment these schemes should help the economy, however at what cost. We will all have to at some stage repay the huge debts that are being taken to help us through these unprecedented times. We anticipate we might hear more about this and potential tax rises later in the year (most likely in autumn).</p>
          
          <p>In this article we aim to summarise each announcement which includes a new Job Retention Bonus Scheme, support for the housing market, VAT cuts and an incentive for us all to return to bars and restaurants.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Job Retention Bonus </strong></p>
          
          <p>- If you have/had staff on furlough and keep them on until at least the end of January 2021, then you as the Employer will be eligible for a one-off bonus of &pound;1000 per employee.</p>
          
          <p>- To qualify the employee must be paid on average at least &pound;520 per month between the 31 October 2020 (end of CJRS) and 31 January 2021.</p>
          
          <p>- The one-off bonuses will be paid out from February 2021. We await further details on whether this bonus will need to be applied for or if it will be automatic.</p>
          
          <p>Note: This is a grant payable to the Employer and for their use. Unlike the furlough payments, which were also paid to the employers but to be passed down to employees.</p>
          
          <p>Now a lot of locum Optometrists and locum Dispensing Opticians trade as owner managed businesses and the question arises, as they have furloughed themselves, if they can also claim for this bonus. The honest answer is we do not know. We do not know whether directors of an owner managed business that have furloughed themselves qualify for the &pound;1k employment bonus if they don&#39;t subsequently make themselves redundant. Further details on this scheme are expected by the end of July.</p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#0000FF">Update 31 July 2020: We can now confirm that this bonus is also applicable for company directors as per todays additional press release. </span></p>
          
          <p style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#0000FF"><em>&quot;Employers can claim the Job Retention Bonus for all employees who meet the above criteria, including office holders, company directors and agency workers, including those employed by umbrella companies&quot;.</em></span></p>
          
          <p><strong>Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) thresholds increased </strong></p>
          
          <p>- SDLT will no longer be due on any property costing below &pound;500k.</p>
          
          <p>- There is no penalty on second home buyers, leading to a maximum saving of &pound;15k on properties of up to &pound;500k (as previously the threshold was &pound;150k) and &pound;10k for first time buyers, whose previous thresholds were &pound;300k.</p>
          
          <p>- This scheme comes into effect immediately and lasts until 31 March 2021.</p>
          
          <p>- The bands remain unchanged for any property over &pound;500k (5% on price &pound;500k to &pound;925k then 10% on &pound;925k to &pound;1.5m then 12% on price above that)</p>
          
          <p>- The savings on SDLT finalises on completion. It will not be applicable for all sales performed or completed before 8<sup>th</sup> July 2020.</p>
          
          <p>- These increases in the thresholds only apply for England and Northern Ireland.</p>
          
          <p>Note: The 3% surcharge still applies on second homes and residential properties purchases through a company</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>VAT cuts</strong></p>
          
          <p>This is something we were all anticipating as it was one of the measures used post the previous 2008 recession also.</p>
          
          <p>- VAT shall be reduced from 20% to 5% on hospitality &amp; tourism sectors. This should translate into a saving of 12.5% in prices. This shall be on all food and non-alcoholic drink from restaurants, bars, caf&eacute;s, etc.</p>
          
          <p>- This reduction comes into effect as of 15<sup>th</sup> July and shall last up until the 12<sup>th </sup>of January 2021.</p>
          
          <p>- What is uncertain is whether this saving will be passed down to you and me (the consumers) or taken by the business.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Eat out to help out</strong></p>
          
          <p>- This scheme is targeted to incentivise consumers back to eateries.</p>
          
          <p>- Under this scheme each individual will be entitled to a 50% discount on their meal, up to a maximum of &pound;10 per person.</p>
          
          <p>- Discounts will only be available if you use it between Monday and Wednesday during the month of August. It can be used an unlimited amount of times.</p>
          
          <p>- The discount will only be applicable at participating establishments, a list we do not have as of yet.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>KickStart schemes</strong></p>
          
          <p>- The government has announced a &pound;2billion fund to help recruitment of new workers who are deemed at risk of long term unemployment.</p>
          
          <p>- Through this scheme the government will pay for all staff up to the age of 24 years old that were on universal credit for at least 6 months. &nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>- The government will cover 100% of the National Minimum Wage for up to 25 hours a week plus associated employer&#39;s National Insurance contributions and employer&rsquo;s minimum automatic pension contributions in addition to an amount to cover overheads</p>
          
          <p>- This scheme is expected to go live by this Autumn</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Training </strong></p>
          
          <p>- Additional funding is announced for recruitment and training of 16 to 24 year olds.</p>
          
          <p>- Each employer will receive &pound;1k per training scheme they offer.</p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:36.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Apprenticeship</strong></p>
          
          <p>- Employers are being encouraged to hire apprentices by being offered &pound;2k for each new recruit under the age of 25 or &pound;1.5k if over 25.</p>
          
          <p>- To be eligible for this money, the recruitment must have taken place between 1 August 2020 and 31 January 2020</p>
          
          <p>- This shall be in addition to the existing &pound;1k that is already given for each new 16-18 year old apprentice.</p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:18.0pt">&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Green homes grants</strong></p>
          
          <p>- The government has announced &pound;2bn worth of grants for green homes in order to increase demand for plumbers, builders and tradespeople.</p>
          
          <p>- The public can claim from this pot by forms of voucher up to a maximum value of &pound;5k (&pound;10k for low income households) from September 2020 to use for making their homes energy efficient.</p>
          
          <p>- We think all Opticians should take advantage of this deal. More information is expected around September time when this will be open to applications.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>We at Locumkit Accounting will continue to update this page, as we get further information from the Government on how these schemes will work and how they will be delivered.</p>

          <p>How does this impact us as Locum Optometrist or Locum Dispensing Optician, especially given that locum work has also started to pick up following the go ahead from NHS England for routine eye examinations?</p>
          
          <p>This is what we as Locum Accountants try to explain in this article, how directors of limited company should calculate their flexible furlough claim and what to be cautious of. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/steps-to-take-before-calculating-your-claim-using-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme#usual-hours">HMRC </a>has published some guidance on how this should be calculated for employees with either fixed or variable hours.</p>
          
          <p>Unlike standard employees there are a few challenges in calculating a locum directors flexible furlough calculation, due to the uncertainty around &lsquo;unusual hours&rsquo;.&nbsp; For us locums, its variable depending on how much we work, which ultimately depends on the rate and location on offer. Many locums whilst may have fixed locums days (which in its own might bring issues re IR35) but will most likely still have some variable element to their locum bookings.</p>
          
          <p>Majority of the locums we know of, if not all, do not have:</p>
          
          <p>- an employment contract in place, hence nothing stating our official &lsquo;usual hours&rsquo; per week.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>- are not paid based on the hours worked but rather based on what is the most tax efficient way</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><u>So how can we decide our hours being a variable paid locum Optometrist or locum dispensing Optician?</u></p>
          
          <p>In these cases, the best approach we believe would be to look back and find out the number days worked as evidence of your calculation for &lsquo;usual hours&rsquo; usually worked. If you have been using the Locumkit app, then you can easily retrieve this information from a click of a button (for the past three years), as one of our many reports available to you reports to you on the number of days worked. In addition, you will need to keep some form of record of the days and hours worked for at least the flexible furlough period, which is where this report can be a great aid. Our financial module does not limit you to only bookings made via Locumkit but also all other bookings (direct or via other agencies).</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p style="text-align:center"><input alt="Locum Optometrist Accountant" src="/media/ckeditor-file/Weekdays.png" style="height:546px; width:582px" type="image" /></p>
          
          <p>Another thing to consider is your time spent on statutory duties (payroll, HMRC compliance work, etc) &ndash; should these now be considered as your working hours and not one for which you can claim furlough? Currently we do not have precise guidance on this but to be prudent we would advise that any time spent on such duties should be taken as your hours worked.</p>
          
          <p>Below we have provided an illustration of how you can go about working your &lsquo;usual hours&rsquo;. When choosing your &#39;usual hours&#39;, always select the higher of your average hours worked in the last financial year vs. the actual hours worked in the same month in the previous year. Your claim would then be based on your hours worked as a proportion of your &#39;usual hours&#39;, multiplied by your monthly salary.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Illustration</strong></p>
          
          <p>In the month of March 2019, Mo locumed 15 days, equating to 112.5 hours (assuming 7.5 hours per working day). In July 2020 Mo shall be locuming 4 days and therefore 30 hours (again assuming 7.5 hours per working day). Mo is on a low salary, high dividends scheme with his monthly salary set at &pound;600 per month. Based on this Mo&rsquo;s furlough claim for the month of July 2020 would be:</p>
          
          <p>(112.5-30)/112.50 x &pound;600 x 80% = &pound;352</p>
          
          <p>Note: The above calculation is for the month of July. This changes in the following months as the scheme wears off. For a recap on the changes please refer to our earlier article on CJRS phase 2 <a href="/blog/cjrsround2">here</a>.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>The claimed amount has reduced (vs. &pound;480) but it has enabled Mo to come off furlough and locum for a few days. Some of us locums have taken up on other jobs as well such as the NHS Clinical Contact Caseworker, which does not have a bearing on your furlough claim. Your furlough claim is only impacted by your primary source of trade, hence locuming for us Optometrist and Dispensing Opticians.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>We at Locumkit accounting have requested for additional guidance from HMRC on how directors should proceed under the flexible scheme. We shall update you as soon as we have more information. In the interim please ensure you have workings to support your calculation for &lsquo;usual hours&rsquo; and evidence for the hours worked.</p>
          
          <p>We have been informed by HMRC that they are aware of the fact that the directors flexible furlough scheme is very much open to abuse and therefore to act as a deterrent the government has given HMRC the powers to investigate your claims for the next five years. We advise you carry out the above calculation correctly and maybe consult a specialist before submission. HMRC have an online calculator, which can help you with this.</p>

          <p>The government announced this measure to assist all self-employed taxpayers (not just the self-employed) with their cash flow during this pandemic.

          <p>This is an automatic offer and no application is required unless you are one of those who have a direct debit mandate setup. If you are one of those and you wish to defer your payment on account due on 31 July 2020 then you should cancel it by contacting the bank.</p>
          
          <p>There will be no interest charged or penalties on any deferral amount. This is a deferral and not a grant and therefore will still need to be paid in January 2020 along with your other liabilities in that time.</p>
          
          <p>However, please note that the deferral is optional, so if you prefer to make the July payment to avoid a larger payment in January 2021, you may do so.</p>

          <p>When launched, due to the situation and nervousness in the market, the CJRS operated based on "pay now, check later". To date it is estimated cÂ£30 billion has been paid to various employers. As part of the â€˜check laterâ€™ HMRC has commenced the process of sending letters to employers, requesting them to review their claims.</p>
          
          <p>The letter asks employers to review their CJRS claims and contact HMRC to confirm whether there has been a mistake or not. This check should include both the numerical accuracy of the claims and the justification for making them. This is likely to be the first stage and it is almost inevitable that more employers will be contacted soon.</p>
          
          <p>The letters are being sent to employers who might have claimed too and/or they claimants never met the conditions for CJRS. It is not helpful that the letters donâ€™t specify what is wrong with the claim, or even which monthâ€™s claim HMRC has an issue with, making it a tedious task to review.</p>
          
          <p>Our understanding these letters have not been sent based on a detailed review of an individualâ€™s claims but more on a generic level.Â  However, if you are one of those who has received the letter, then it needs paying attention to as inaccurate responses can be used as the basis for a fraudulent investigation.</p>
          
          <p>As this was a brand-new scheme and a massive learning curve for all involved, there are undoubtedly errors which have been made in calculating furlough pay. We at Locumkit understand that HMRCâ€™s focus is not on cases where an actual error has been made but to focus on potential fraudulent claims.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Ambiguity of HMRC letter</strong></p>
          
          <p>As stated above, the letter from HMRC asks you to review your claims but does not state:</p>
          
          <ul>
              <li>Which claim period they are asking you to review; or</li>
              <li>If there was an over claim, by how much it might be; or</li>
              <li>Who the potential ineligible employees are</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>This could result in a mammoth task where you will have to go through each submitted claim and revisit your calculations. See our Locumkit tips below on how to review your calculations etc.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What to do?</strong></p>
          
          <p>Always respond to an enquiry from HMRC, whether you think you have a problem or not. If HMRC have the impression they are being ignored, they will step up their enquiries into your business.</p>
          
          <ul>
              <li>If you believe your claims were accurate then you are asked to contact HMRC by telephone to discuss this</li>
              <li>If you have found errors in your claim, you are then asked to reply by email, and then instructions will be given to make a formal disclosure.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><br />
          <strong>Potential fine </strong></p>
          
          <p>If deemed to be inaccurate claims, HMRC has the power to recover amounts equivalent to CJRS payments by imposing a tax charge (penalty) equivalent to 100% of any payment to which the recipient was not entitled to. This charge (penalty) is applicable regardless of if the inaccurate claim was due to a genuine error or intentional.<br />
          <br />
          To avoid penalty and interest on inaccurate claims, HMRC has given you a period of grace to revisit your claims and offer a voluntary correction.<br />
          <br />
          The date by which an employer must notify overpayments to HMRC is the latest of:<br />
          (a) 90 days after receiving CJRS monies to which it was not entitled;<br />
          (b) 90 days after a change of circumstances, so that it was no longer entitled to CJRS monies; and<br />
          (c) 20 October 2020, provided that (a) or (b) was before 20 July 2020.<br />
          <br />
          Due to condition â€˜Câ€™ above, we recommend you act now to review and make any voluntary disclosures, before 20 October 2020 to avoid any fines. In addition, we strongly recommend that you engage with a specialist before responding to HMRC, particularly if it is necessary to notify HMRC of any potential liabilities.</p>

          <p>The grant will be limited to self-employed individuals who are currently eligible for the SEISS and are actively continuing to trade but are facing reduced demand due to COVID-19.&nbsp; For the Self-employed locums who were eligible, the good news is that now the scheme is extended to 30th April 2021. This will again be split into two parts (Nov-Jan and then February to April). Yes, it seems like they have forgotten about the months of September and October. In the initial period you will be entitled to a maximum grant of 20% of &lsquo;average monthly profits&rsquo; capped at &pound;1,875 for each three-month period (not per month). It is not clear when applications will open or close for this grant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>The amount of support for the second part has not yet been clarified &ndash; all we know is that the grant may be adjusted if economic circumstances change.</p>
          
          <p>Summary of SEIS grants to date:</p>
          
          <p>- 1st SEISS grant was 80%, capped at &pound;7,500.<br />
          - 2nd SEISS grant was 70%, capped at &pound;6,570.<br />
          - 3rd SEISS grant is 20%, capped at &pound;1,875.<br />
          - 4th SEISS grant is ??%, capped at &pound;?</p>
          
          <p><strong><span style="color:#0000FF">Update: 02/10/2020</span></strong></p>
          
          <p>We have had some update on the eligibility criteria for next set of grants, some of which I believe we as locum Optoms need to take into consideration.</p>
          
          <p>We at Locumkit Accountants have been informed that to be eligible for the next set for SEIS grants you must:</p>
          
          <p>- have been in receipt and/or be eligible for the first set two SEISS grants (please review our previous blogs for a reminder of the eligibility criteria&rsquo;s);</p>
          
          <p>- be impacted by &lsquo;reduced demand&rsquo; due to COVID-19 in the qualifying period; and</p>
          
          <p>- be &lsquo;actively trading&rsquo; and have full intention to continue to trade: This means actively working as a locum, irrespective of reduced workload.</p>
          
          <p>It is the third category, which I feel some of us locums might find ourselves maybe foul of. I myself, as a locum started working as a NHS Test &amp; Trace Contact Tracer during the lockdown and ceased all locum work for the interim. Some of our clients like me who locum have mentioned that they are not looking to return to locuming anytime soon, whether it be due to safety concerns, rate, or any other reasons. This produces the the risk of us not being eligible for the grant &ndash; as we won&rsquo;t be &lsquo;actively trading&rsquo;. Now if we return to work for say one day, will that suffice as &lsquo;actively trading&rsquo;; this is something we are trying to find out.</p>
          
          <p>Previously the second phase of the SEIS grant was conditional on your trade being &lsquo;adversely affected&rsquo;, which is fairly easy to substantiate for us locums. However now HMRC have tightened this condition by saying it must have been impacted by &lsquo;reduced demand&rsquo;. Again, what &lsquo;reduced demand&rsquo; means is ambiguous and is something we are actively trying to find further information on.</p>
          
          <p>We have also been informed that the reason for no specific mention of reduction in earnings in any of the criteria&rsquo;s to be eligible for the grant is intentional. Hence, we would strongly advise you not to confuse &lsquo;adversely affected&rsquo; or &lsquo;actively trading&rsquo; with your level of earnings (albeit they are interlinked). What we understand is that not accepting locum work due to reduced rates, despite work being available is not enough to meet &lsquo;reduced training&rsquo;.</p>
          
          <p>We also queried about the periods which seem to have been overlooked for grants to which we have been informed that the SEISS grants do not relate to any particular periods or do not seek to replace lost income over a particular period. Therefore, SEISS is not intended to provide a month-by-month replacement of income.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>For all locums who have not applied for your second SEIS grant, please do before the 19 October 2020, when application will close.</p>
          
          <p>A question that a few of our clients have asked us it that is this grant taxable?</p>
          
          <p>Yes, these grants are taxable (income tax, NI in the 2020/21 tax year). We understand that a specific section will be brought in for the 20/21 self-assessment tax return for the reporting of SEISS grants. If you need help with your self-assessment tax returns, please do contact us and we can discuss with you how we at Locumkit can assist you.</p>

          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Job Support Scheme</strong></span></p>
          
          <p>The current furlough scheme will end on 31 October, and as a replacement the Chancellor announced the introduction of the new Job Support Scheme, which comes into effect 1 November.</p>
          
          <p>Based on early literature we understand:</p>
          
          <p>- Is open to all small and medium-sized businesses &ndash; This should cover all Independent Opticians, Owner Managed Buisnesses (Locums trading as Directors)</p>
          
          <p>- Will also support larger firms whose turnover has dramatically fallen in recent months.</p>
          
          <p>- Can be used even IF the employee was previously furloughed as long as they were on the payroll as of 23 September 2020.</p>
          
          <p>- Employees must work at least a third of their contracted working hours.</p>
          
          <p>- Employers must pay for this percentage of their employees&rsquo; wages.</p>
          
          <p>- For every remaining contracted hour not worked, the Government and the employer will pay a third of the shortfall in the employee&rsquo;s usual pay (Governments contribution is capped at &pound;697.92 per month)</p>
          
          <p>This means for an employee working 33% of their hours, will receive at least 77% of their usual salary. We have been informed that this can come across as confusing, it is therefore we have tried to further express this point.</p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:18.0pt">With the employer working at least 1/3 of their hours, they are contractually due payment for that 1/3. That leaves 2/3 of usual/expected pay, of which a 1/3 is paid by the employer and a further 1/3 by the Government as a grant. We understand that the employer will bear the cost of the employer&rsquo;s NI and pension contributions on all the employee&#39;s pay.</p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:18pt">Example: Normal salary &pound;2,000 per month</p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:18pt">Works a 1/3 of the usual hours so due &pound;660</p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:18pt">Then the employer and the Government contribute a further 1/3 of the remaining amount &ndash; so &pound;442.20 each. This mean the employee gets a total of &pound;1544,40 (77% of their normal pay).</p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:18pt">&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>As soon as there are more details on how the scheme will operate and how employers can apply we at Locumkit Accountants will update you.</p>
          
          <p>The Job Support Scheme is designed to work in tandem with the Jobs Retention Bonus, providing they are kept on until February 2021.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>As mentioned in our previous article there were multiple Coronavirus loan schemes that the Government announced to aid businesses with cash flow during these unprecedented times. In today&rsquo;s announcement the Government has extended its payment terms and the deadline by when Businesses need to apply for these schemes.</p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Bounce Back Loans (BBL)</strong></span></p>
          
          <p>The Bounce Back Loans scheme, which provides between &pound;2,000 and &pound;50,000 in funding to businesses, capped at 25% of turnover, has introduced a new &lsquo;Pay As You Grow&rsquo; repayments system. In addition, the deadline to apply has been extended to 31 December 2020.</p>
          
          <p>This means that you will now be able to repay your Bounce Bank Loan over ten years instead of six, so fewer monthly repayments.</p>
          
          <p>In addition, if your business is really struggling then you also now have the option</p>
          
          <p>- To pause your repayments entirely for up to six months. This option can only be used once and used after the first repayments have been made; or</p>
          
          <p>- To temporarily only make interest-only payments for periods of up to six months. This option can be used a maximum of three times.</p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS)</strong></span></p>
          
          <p>The&nbsp;deadline for new applications for the above two schemes has been extended until 30th November 2020.</p>
          
          <p>The Government has extended the guarantee of these loans for up to ten years.</p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>VAT</strong></span></p>
          
          <p>If you were one of the business that opted to defer your VAT bills earlier in the year, then now you can make these repayments over 11 monthly instalments, with no interest to pay.</p>
          
          <p>The Chancellor also spoke up in support of the tourism and hospitality sectors, with the end of its reduced rate of VAT in sight on 13th January 2021. Mr Sunak confirmed that the 5% VAT rate for tourism and hospitality firms would remain in place until 31st March 2021.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Self-assessment liabilities</strong></span></p>
          
          <p>It&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom for the locums who have missed out. The only grace for those locums (including the ones who were not excluded) is that you can delay your tax payments due in January 2021 (in the same way that the July 2020 payment was deferred), if the liability is more than &pound;30,000.</p>
          
          <p>Deferral of your 31<sup>st</sup> January liability means you can defer your</p>
          
          <p>- Second payment on account (POA) 2019/20</p>
          
          <p>- Balancing payment 2019/20</p>
          
          <p>- First POA 2020/21</p>
          
          <p>No interest will be charged on the late paid tax. Unlike the July deferral, self employed locums will have to apply for this deferral over 12 monthly instalments, up to January 2022.</p>
          
          <p>Note: You can defer your liability, but you still have to submit a tax return by the 31st January 2021 (if filled online). At Locumkit, as fellow locum Optoms, we know how Covid has affected our work and the rates on display. Being Accountnats for Opticians, we at Locumkit Accountants are offering our own COVID relief and have decided to offer all locums 6 months free (50%) off on our Accountancy services based on the fact that our work level has reduced by 50% year on year (I know mine has).

          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Furlough scheme extended (Job Support Scheme deferred) </strong></span></p>
          
          <p>A very last-minute announcement which meant that for us Accountants it was a flurry of changes as we were just getting ready for the Job Support Scheme. But alas, this news has been a welcome news for our clients and anyone who has had staff on furlough.</p>
          
          <p>We are back to August, with 80% of wages covered by the Government and the employer bears pensions and secondary NICs. Businesses will have flexibility to bring furloughed employees back to work on a part time basis or furlough them full-time. Employers can claim the grant for the hours their employees are not working, calculated by reference to their usual hours worked in a claim period. Such calculations will broadly follow the same methodology as currently under the CJRS.</p>
          
          <p>Although the lockdown comes into force from 5 November to 2 December 2020, the financial support for the furlough scheme is scheduled to run from 1 November as the furlough scheme operates on full calendar months.</p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#0000FF">If you missed out on the previous furlough schemes as you were not on the payroll in time then you can still be eligible for this furlough, given your accountant had you enrolled on the PAYE payroll by 30th October 2020 midnight. Note if your payroll is processed on the last day of the month, then you should have had a payslip in September to have been on PAYE by 30 October 2020. There are rumours that lockdown could be extended beyond 2 December; will this mean a further extension to the furlough scheme? Maybe and could be wise thinking about getting yourself on the payroll by end of November 2020 to be in a chance for any extended furlough schemes.</span></p>
          
          <p>We have been informed that employees on any type of contract can qualify, including zero hours. There has been no clear indication on whether contractors or directors are included but we are hopeful directors will be eligible as they were for the previous furlough scheme.</p>
          
          <p><span style="color:rgb(0, 0, 255)"><strong>Updated 12/11/2020:</strong> </span></p>
          
          <p>We can now confirm that Limited company locum Optometrists and locum Dispensing Opticians&nbsp;can again furlough themselves (full or flexi furlough) for the PAYE element of their salary for the time not worked. As per before, whilst on furlough you can only carry out your statutory duties for the company. You can still take on another job, so if you are doing NHS Test &amp; Trace then that is fine.</p>
          
          <p>With the extension of the furlough scheme and the new cut-off date of 30/10/2020 a few more employees, locum directors have now become eligible for the scheme. We now have some further information on key elements that we feel you could find useful as locums, employers:</p>
          
          <p><u>Payment reference &amp; usual hours calculation:</u></p>
          
          <p>If you were e<span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); color:rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family:inherit; font-size:inherit">ligible for the former CJRS then your payment reference period remains the same as per the earlier calculations, irrespective of if you increased your salary since or never claimed earlier on.&nbsp;</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); color:rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family:inherit; font-size:inherit">Your usual hours calculation will remain unchanged - to review how to calculate this please click <a href="/blog/locum-on-flexible-furlough">here</a></span></p>
          
          <p>If this is the first time you are claiming and you were not eligible for the previous CJRS then your payment reference period is the last payslip prior to 30 October 2020 (most likely your September payslip). This is the case for most limited company locum Optometrists or locum Dispensing Opticians on fixed pay. In addition, your usual hours are calculated as per the hours you worked in your last pay period.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><u>Deadlines</u></p>
          
          <p>If you are one who is eligible and are applying for this then make sure you or your accountant is informed as any claims for the prior period have to be submitted by the 14th of the next month (i.e. November claims need to be submitted by 14th December). This is fourteen days but as Accountants and having for Locum Optometrists and Locum Dispensing Opticians as clients we know how if all of our clients come near the end of the deadline period, it can lead to a lot of calculation and work to do within a short time. So please be prepared in advance.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><u>Rehires</u></p>
          
          <p>If you are an owner of an Optical practice and have recently made some redundancy then you can rehire them and place your staff on furlough, given that they were on your payroll on 23 September 2020.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><u>Furlough agreements</u></p>
          
          <p>Whether you are an Optical employer or a locum director, please ensure you have a furlough agreement in place as was required for the original CJRS schemes.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>As further guidance and clarification is provided, we at Locumkit will keep you updated.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>What about the self-employed sole trader?</strong></span></p>
          
          <p>A lot of our clients as locums&rsquo; sole traders have asked this question.</p>
          
          <p>The latest news is that we are expecting an increase to the SEIS from the intended 40% but do not currently know exactly by how much and for how long. Further information is due later this week on this.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#000000">Updated:</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#000000">It is now confirmed that the SEIS has been extended from 1 November 2020 for another six months up to 30 April 2021. The grants will be paid in two lump sums, each covering for a period of 3 months (1 Nov to&nbsp;31 Jan and then 1 Feb to 30 April 21). <strong>There is scope for locum optometrist and locum dispensing opticians who missed out on the earlier SEIS schemes to be in scope for SEIS 4.&nbsp;</strong>The claim period for the first lump sum (SEIS 3) will open from 30 November 2020. More information is due to come out shortly but what we do know is:</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#000000">- To be eligible for SEIS 3 you must have been eligible for the earlier SEIS schemes</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#000000">- You must declare that your trade is still &#39;adversely&#39; affected and are still &#39;actively&#39; trading</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#000000">The grant, as per the first grant, shall be set at 80% of your trading profits (capped at &pound;2,5k) for SEIS 3. The government will review the level of grant for SEIS 4 in due course.&nbsp;</span></p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#000000">The grants remain subject to taxes.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the excluded are still excluded, so if you were NOT eligible for the first two, you will not be eligible for this also. The window for application shall open at the end of November and not as first prescribed, in the middle of December.&nbsp;</span></p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong><span style="color:#0000FF"><u>Updated 24/11/2020:</u></span></strong></p>
          
          <p>HMRC have released further guidance on the third SEIS grant which will open for applications from the 30th November 2020. You can apply up to 29 January 2021 and are advised to carefully consider your eligibility before applying.</p>
          
          <p>To make a claim for the third grant:&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>- your locuming must have had a new or continuing impact from coronavirus between 1 November 2020 and 29 January 2021</p>
          
          <p>- be currently trading but are impacted by reduced demand due to coronavirus (note: this is a reduced demand from employers and not you choosing to not to work. HMRC can do an investigation into the Optical industry as a whole and make a judgement if there was reduced work or not, although we think this in highly unlikely &ndash; being a locum myself, I get emails from various recruiters and other agencies and have noticed demand to be back to pre Covid levels, albeit at reduced rates)</p>
          
          <p>- have been trading but are temporarily unable to do so due to coronavirus (unlikely to apply to us as Opticians are open to trade)</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>You must also declare that:</p>
          
          <p>- you intend to continue to trade as a locum</p>
          
          <p>- you reasonably believe there will be a significant reduction in your trading profits (due to reduced business activity, capacity or demand or inability to trade due to coronavirus and not your own choosing)</p>
          
          <p>HMRC will send invitation to all self-employed based on their historical filings of self-assessments. The duty and onus of applying is on us, hence on us to decide whether the reduction in trade is significant.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>We advise all locums to ensure they have and keep all evidence to shows how your locuming has been impacted by coronavirus, resulting in less locum days/bookings. This can be in many forms, some of which are:</p>
          
          <p>- Your financial and/or bank statement showing reduction in activity compared to previous year&#39;s corresponding period (so if you are earning roughly as much as you were previously, then you are likely not seeing a significant reduction to trading)</p>
          
          <p>- Fewer invoices being issued (with our cloud software Locumkit, you can see your invoices and other reporting all online)</p>
          
          <p>- NHS Test and Trace communications if you&rsquo;ve been instructed to self-isolate</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>HMRC have provided some examples of what defines a reduction in demand. Below we have taken a few of them and added our own understanding of them and how it can be reflected on us locum Optometrists or locum Dispensing Opticians:</p>
          
          <p style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#808080"><em>&quot;A cafe owner has fewer customers due to government restrictions on households mixing, which initially reduces her takings. She increases her prices and believes her trading profits will not reduce significantly, so she is not eligible to claim the third grant.&quot;</em></span></p>
          
          <p style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#808080"><em>&quot;A plasterer cannot get materials due to supply chain issues due to coronavirus. This has reduced the amount of work he can complete and be paid for, but he manages to quickly find a new supplier. He does not believe that the reduced demand will cause a significant reduction in his trading profits. He is not eligible to claim the third grant.&quot;</em></span></p>
          
          <p>If you were locuming for Scrivens Opticians historically but now are not locuming for them anymore due to lack of work and have substituted that for locuming for Specsavers - this change in company will not constitute as a reduction in trade.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#808080"><em>&quot;An electrician is still trading but has had increased costs due to buying masks, cleaning supplies and screens. She is not eligible for the third grant because increased costs were the only impact on her business, and she has not lost customers.&quot;</em></span></p>
          
          <p>Previously an increase in costs was enough to be eligible to apply for the grant but this is no longer the case. Hence if you as a locum have had to or are having to purchase your own PPE, gloves etc, this will no longer be enough to meet the eligibility criteria for SEIS 3.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align:center"><em>&quot;A dentist returns from a holiday abroad and has to self-isolate for 14 days due to quarantine rules. As this is the only impact on her business, she is not eligible to claim the third grant. This is because reduced demand due to self-isolation after foreign travel is not included in the eligibility criteria.&quot;</em></p>
          
          <p>Isolations following a holiday (based on where you went) will mean that you locum less and hence will have a reduction in income. However, this reduction income is not considered as part of your analysis as significant reduction in trade, despite the isolation being a Government requirement.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align:center"><span style="color:#808080"><em>&quot;An accountant reduces his business activity because he wants to partially retire. He reasonably believes this will have a significant reduction on his trading profits. He is not eligible for third grant because the reduced business activity was not caused by coronavirus.&quot;</em></span></p>
          
          <p>We at Locumkit would like to highlight this point as I know many locums like me have not gone back to work since Lockdown 1, whether that is due to having alternative employment such as NHS Test and Trace or anything else. Choosing not to go to work and showing that you have had an impact to your trading is not accepted by HMRC and could lead to improper application.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Mortgage holiday extension</strong></span></p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Mortgage holidays payments have also been extended.</p>
          
          <p>- You may be entitled to a 6-month mortgage payment holiday if you have been impacted by coronavirus and have not yet had applied for a mortgage payment holiday</p>
          
          <p>- If you have already applied for a mortgage payment holiday then you will be able to top up to six months without this being recorded on their credit file</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Business Grants</strong></span></p>
          
          <p>Businesses that are required to close in England as a result of the local or national lockdowns are now eligible for grants depending on your properties rateable value:</p>
          
          <p>- Rateable value of &pound;15k or less - &pound;1,334 per month or &pound;667 per two weeks;</p>
          
          <p>- Rateable value of between &pound;15k-&pound;51k - &pound;2,000 per month or &pound;1,000 per two weeks;</p>
          
          <p>- Rateable value of &pound;51k or more - &pound;3,000 per month or &pound;1,500 per two weeks.</p>
          
          <p>It seems like the above would be applicable for us as Opticians do not come into the list of businesses that are required to closed.</p>

      array('title' => 'Can we still have a Christmas party?', 'slug' => 'xmaspartyforoptoms', 'description' => '<p>So, with Christmas fast approaching, it is the time of the year where we would normally start to look forward to our get together with family and friends. Another thing we normally start to look forward to is our work Christmas party and/or dinners.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>However, this year is unlike any other, with the pandemic and the governments restrictions of social distancing, the traditional work Christmas parties do not seem like a plausible option.</p>
          
          <p>Substituting a party for a cash gift might not be as welcoming for employees as thought as the gift can come with tax charges attached. Hence some employers have started to think about an online virtual party, but would this have any tax implication for the employer and employee?</p>
          
          <p>Employers are usually allowed to spend up to &pound;150 per head including non-employee guests (with certain conditions) per annum towards the costs of annual function(s) such as a Christmas party or a summer barbeque without creating a tax liability for either the employees or the employer.&nbsp;However, there was some uncertainty on what would be allowed this year, especially if employers carry out virtual parties.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Well we are pleased to announce that HMRC have stepped up and proven that it is not the scrooge as some might believe it to be - they have announced their part to spread the Christmas cheer:</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><em><strong>Having considered the scope of section 264 ITEPA03 (annual parties exemption), we are pleased to confirm that the exemption will apply to the costs associated with virtual parties in the same way that it would for traditionally held, parties.</strong><br />
          <br />
          <strong>&quot;Therefore, the cost of providing food, entertainment, equipment and other expenses which may be incurred in hosting a virtual event, will be exempt, subject to the normal conditions of the exemption being met.</strong><br />
          <br />
          <strong>&quot;It is important to note that the intention of the exemption is to allow for costs of provision which are generally incurred for the purposes of the event itself, and that the event, along with any associated provision, is available to employees generally. &rdquo;&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>HMRC will be providing further detail on this and we shall keep updating this blog as that happens.</p>
          
          <p>Whilst this is welcoming news we at Locumkit do strongly advise any employers who might start planning a virtual event that they consider it carefully as you might be requested to demonstrate attendance at an virtual event for it to qualify for the exemption.</p>

      array('title' => 'We make switching Accountants easy', 'slug' => 'switching-opticians-accountants', 'description' => '<p>We are often approached by other locums who have asked us about changing Accountants and wanting to switch to us. Some of them were informed that switching Accountants is a time consuming and expensive process.</p>
          
          <p>However, switching Accountants can be done with minimal stress, effort and disruption. It is as simple as a patient choosing to visit another Opticians for their next eye examination. Just as the new Optician can obtain all previous records (prescriptions, recall visits, etc.) we as Accountants can obtain all your previous filings and if not we can still cater for you just as an Optician can still provide a comprehensive eye examination for a first time patient.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Why may one want to change their Accountant?</strong></p>
          
          <p>There could be several reasons one might look to change Accountants. The most common reasons shared with us by incoming clients are:</p>
          
          <div>- Not getting value for money;&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- The Accountant did not really understand the Optics industry and/or locuming;&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- The Accountant was not proactive in finding tax-saving opportunities or keeping them up to date with the latest financial news; and</div>
          
          <div>- The Accountant seemed to be doing things the old-fashioned way, i.e. not offering online cloud-based solutions.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;
          <div><strong>If you are intending to cut ties with your Accountant, we advise you check the following:&nbsp;</strong></div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div><u>Loose ends:</u></div>
          
          <div>We advise that all open financial responsibility has been closed, for example ensure all your invoices are paid and neither you or your Accountant is waiting on an action or payment. Disputes over unpaid fees is the most common and significant threat to the smooth transfer.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div><u>Timing:</u></div>
          
          <div>You should consider when is the best time for the change from your current to your prospective accountant. Ideally you will want to choose a date when there is little to no active activity between you and your existing Accountant. If you need any advice on this, please contact us and we can help you.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div><u>Disengagement notification:</u></div>
          
          <div>You will need to notify your current Accountant, ideally in writing, advising them of your intent to shift to another firm.</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div><u>Registering with a new accountant:</u></div>
          
          <div>Upon registering with a new Accountant, you should expect to receive a registration form, the purpose of which is to capture your personal and if applicable, limited company information.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>Your Accountant should also issue you a letter of engagement, which sets out the expectations of each party, the stipulated fees, and the level of service which will be provided.</div>
          
          <div>According to UK law, your new Accountant will carry out anti-money laundering checks on you, so you will have to provide a scan of your passport or driving license as well as a recent utility bill.</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div><u>Assigning authority:&nbsp;</u></div>
          
          <div>Upon formalising the agreement, you will be asked to assign authority to your new Accountants for tax affairs, enabling them to file returns on your behalf.</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div><u>Letter requesting Professional Clearance:</u></div>
          
          <div>Your new accountant may write to your previous accountants requesting what is known as professional clearance. A letter requesting documents from the previous accountant such as copies of accounts, tax records, tax returns and any other information that may be needed to act as your Accountants.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div style="text-align: center;"><span style="color:#0000FF">Although this may seem like a lot of work but once you have decided that you would like to move, most if not all of the work is done by your new respective accountants, which means you just wait for them to carry out their paperwork.&nbsp;</span></div>
          
          <div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</div>
          </div>
          
          <p><strong>Other things to consider:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><u>Relationships</u></p>
          
          <p>When you assign a new accountant, you are assigning someone who you are entrusting to keep your financial welfare at bay. A healthy relationship is typified by constant communication, whether direct or indirect, sharing of information and, ultimately, trust. A good accountant will be pro-active in their approach, keeping in regular contact to make sure you&rsquo;re kept abreast of how things are going; after all, it&rsquo;s your money.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>At Locumkit, we believe that accounting is about more than just compliance and number crunching. It&rsquo;s about developing great relationships, overcoming obstacles, providing solutions, and helping you be stress free and able to focus on what you have been trained to do, examine eyes. We can be found at various Optical Exhibitions or CET events, where we like you, would be looking to get our CET points. We are also actively involved in other Optical groups, always seeking to keep you informed with tailored news that could be of interest. We have been highly credited for our team&rsquo;s communications during the Covid pandemic, helping Opticians navigate through the unprecedented levels of ambiguity and confusion associated with the Chancellor&rsquo;s schemes.&nbsp;</p>

          <u>Delivering on business promises</u></p>
          
          <p>A good accountant should always be one stride ahead when it comes to your business. But if you feel that you are always on the back foot, when it comes to being asked for information or are constantly chasing or missing deadlines, then it&rsquo;s time to change.</p>

          <p>Customer testimonials are a great way to learn about the accountant through other peoples&rsquo; experiences. It is important that your accountant understands your business. They should get to know your goals and how you operate. Ideally, you need someone who can provide both.</p>

      array('title' => 'Self Employment payment plan', 'slug' => 'se-payment-plan-for-locums', 'description' => '<div>With Covid starting to impact our trade last year, HMRC had announced a number of measures to help us with our cashflow. One of these being an automatic deferral of our &lsquo;Payment on Account&rsquo;, which was due on July 2020.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>What this meant is that our liability for this Self-Assessment is going to be a lot more than what are used to seeing.</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>The liability will be a cumulative of:</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- the July 20 deferred second payment on account;</div>
          
          <div>- balancing payment for 19/20;</div>
          
          <div>- first payment on account for 20/21 (this is calculated as half of your total 19/20 liability);</div>
          
          <div>- any capital gains tax for 2019/20; and</div>
          
          <div>- class 2 and 4 National Insurance Contributions for 19/20.</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>With the pandemic still upon us, HMRC realise that many self-employed like us locum Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians are still facing a reduce in trade and hence a hit to our pockets.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>It is therefore they have allowed for a spread of the liability over the course of the next 12 months. This can only be done given you meet the all of the following conditions:</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- You must agree to pay the liability monthly by direct debit;&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- You must have submitted your 19/20 self-assessment tax return;&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- You must have prior tax returns outstanding;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- Your tax liability should be no more than &pound;30,000; and&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- You should have no other tax instalment agreements in place.</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>It normally takes HMRC up to 72 hours to fully acknowledge and process your tax return. What this means is that if you are one to leave your filing to the very last minute then you might find that you are not being offered the payment plan as HMRC has not yet processed your 19/20 return.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div><u>Things to consider</u></div>
          
          <div>&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- You can choose the number of instalments that you would like to spread your liability over in 2021.&nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- If you miss any of these payment plans, then and unpaid tax will accrue interest at 2.6% until paid.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
          
          <div>- You must have your instalment plan set up within 60 days after the due date for the tax (31 Jan 2021). If a payment plan is not in place and you have not paid your 19/20 liability, then an automatic penalty is imposed at 5% of the outstanding tax.&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

We believe in general this budget has been good for small independent Opticians and self-employed locums Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians. The government introduced further support in the extension of the Job Retention Scheme and Self-Employed Support Scheme, with an extension business rates and additional grants to help business reboot.</p>
          
          <p>Albeit there is one thing the chancellor has again overlooked, in its help to the one-man limited company, which is a form a lot of locums Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians trade as. There was no announcement of any further support for small limited company directors who take most of their income through dividends and can only claim a small amount on the Job Retention Scheme.</p>
          
          <p>At Locumkit Accounting, we can help you make sense of the Budget and of what it means for your business, so please don&rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch with us today for more information.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Below we present the highlights from the Budget with a focus on how it can impact us within the Optical industry.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p style="text-align:start"><span style="color:#3A3C41; font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10.5pt"><span style="color:#3A3C41; font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10.5pt">​</span></span><strong><span style="color:#3A3C41; font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10.5pt"><span style="color:#3A3C41; font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10.5pt">Furlough scheme extended to the end of September 2021</span></span></strong></p>
          
          <p>Extension to furlough payments for workers who can&rsquo;t work because of pandemic restrictions until the end of September. However, after July, businesses will have to contribute 10% and, in August and September, 20%. This is in addition to the&nbsp;employer&#39;s&nbsp;national insurance and pension contributions they are already paying on hours not worked by employees.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>The &pound;2,500 monthly limit for the grant remains in place.</p>
          
          <p>All employees who were on the PAYE Real Time Information (RTI) on or before 2 March 2021 are eligible to be furloughed for periods starting on or after 1 May 2021.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;<br />
          <strong>Extension of the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) and newly self-employed also now eligible</strong></p>
          
          <p>If you were one of the locums who started locuming post April 2019, you most likely would have missed out on the early grants. However, with having filed your recent 2019/20 self-assessment (by midnight on 2 March 2021) you will now be able to benefit from grant 4 and 5, given you meet all the other criteria&rsquo;s. All other eligibility criteria will remain the same as the third grant. Further details will be published in due course.</p>
          
          <p>If you were already eligible for the first three grants, now your self-employment average earnings will be based on the four years to 2019-20.</p>
          
          <p>The fourth SEISS grant, covering February to April, will be paid in line with previous SEISS grants at 80% of average trading profits, up to a maximum of &pound;2,500 a month.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <u>Fifth grant</u><br />
          The fifth grant will be dependent upon the reduction in income, where you will be able to get the full 80% if turnover is reduced by 30% or more. If turnover has fallen by less than 30%, then the grant is reduced to 30% (capped at &pound;2,850). The drop in income will be for the period from April 2020 to April 2021.<br />
          Recovery Loan Scheme</p>
          
          <p>This scheme replaces the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, which are due to cease on 31st March 2021.</p>
          
          <p>From 6th April 2021, the Recovery Loan Scheme will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on eligible loans between &pound;25,000 and &pound;10 million. The scheme will be open to all businesses, including those who have already received support under the existing COVID-19 guaranteed loan schemes. We&rsquo;ll give further details on the new scheme once they&rsquo;re available.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>New Restart Grants to help businesses reopen in England</strong></p>
          
          <p>In a bid to support the reopening of non-essential retailers, as well as the hospitality and leisure sectors, the&nbsp;Government is launching Restart Grants open to businesses throughout England.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Non-essential retail&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;will be able to claim for cash grants of up to &pound;6,000&nbsp;per premises,&nbsp;while&nbsp;hospitality, accommodation, leisure, personal care and gym&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;can&nbsp;claim up to &pound;18,000&nbsp;per premises&nbsp;given their later reopening date.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>According to the guidance provided by the government, to be eligible you must meet the following criteria:</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;- Be based in England;<br />
          &nbsp;- Be based on a property which pays business rates;<br />
          &nbsp;- Had or have been required to close because of the national lockdown from 5 January 2021 onwards or between 5 November and 2 December; and<br />
          &nbsp;- Has been unable to provide the same level of in person customer service from its premises</p>
          
          <p>We feel it is the last point, which can make Opticians potentially eligible for this scheme, especially whilst many have had triaging, appointments only policy during these lockdowns.</p>
          
          <p>Applications for these grants are done through your local authority and will be open for applications from April 2021.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Corporation Tax to increase for larger companies</strong></p>
          
          <p>The Corporation Tax rate will remain at 19% for business profits up to &pound;50,000 but will have a tapered increase to a main rate of 25% for profits over &pound;250,000 from April 2023.</p>
          
          <p>Companies with profits between &pound;50,000 and &pound;250,000 will pay tax at the main rate of 25% reduced by a marginal relief providing a gradual increase in the effective Corporation Tax rate.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>This will in evidently mean better tax planning is required on behalf of both locums and Optical store owners as to ensure you remain compliant with the new rules but also the most tax efficient.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>VAT</strong></p>
          
          <p>VAT will remain at 5% until the end of September and then gradually increased to 12.5% for another six months before returning to the full 20% rate in April 2022. No other changes are being made to VAT.</p>
          
          <p>The threshold for businesses to register for VAT will remain at &pound;85,000 until 2024.</p>
          
          <p>No changes to the VAT rates impacting Opticians, with our services remaining exempt from VAT and standard rates applying on sales of spectacles, contact lenses and any accessories &ndash; hence partial exemption rules will apply as normal.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Business rates reliefs</strong></p>
          
          <p>The business rate was due to end on March 31, but will now be extended in full until June 30, followed by 66% business rates relief for the period from 1st July 2021 to 31st March 2022, capped at &pound;2 million per business for properties that were required to be closed on 5th January 2021, or &pound;105,000 per business for other eligible properties.</p>
          
          <p>Eligible properties are those in the retail, hospitality and leisure industries.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Apprenticeships</strong></p>
          
          <p>Payment increased to &pound;3,000 (from &pound;1.5k &amp; &pound;2k)and deadline to apply to September 2021. This is in addition to the existing &pound;1,000 payment provided for all new 16-18-year-old apprentices, and those under 25 with an Education, Health and Care Plan.</p>
          
          <p>A flexi-apprenticeship scheme was also announced that will allow apprentices to work with multiple employers in a sector.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Statutory Sick Pay</strong></p>
          
          <p>If you own an independent Opticians (i.e. small to medium-sized business) then you can reclaim up to two weeks of eligible Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) costs per employee from the government.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Income Tax Rates and Thresholds</strong></p>
          
          <p>Personal Allowance (&pound;12,570) and basic rate&nbsp;income tax&nbsp;limit&nbsp;(&pound;50,270) are&nbsp;to be frozen&nbsp;at their 2021/22 levels&nbsp;until 2026. &nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>National Insurance&nbsp;Contributions&nbsp;Upper Earnings Limit and Upper Profits Limit will remain aligned to the higher rate&nbsp;income tax&nbsp;threshold at &pound;50,270 for these years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>National Minimum Wage</strong></p>
          
          <p>National Minimum Wage to increase to &pound;8.91 per hour from 1 April 2021.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Inheritance Tax</strong></p>
          
          <p>The threshold for paying Inheritance Tax has not changed at &pound;325,000 and will be maintained up to 2026.</p>
          
          <p>The&nbsp;Government&nbsp;intend to maintain the IHT tax-free thresholds and the residence nil rate band taper available for Inheritance Tax at their 2020/21 tax year levels&nbsp;for the next 5 years (up to and including&nbsp;2025/26).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>This means qualifying estates can continue to pass on up to &pound;500,000 and the qualifying estate of a surviving spouse or civil partner can&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;continue to pass on up to &pound;1 million&nbsp;of assets&nbsp;without an Inheritance Tax liability.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong></p>

HMRC will be writing to approximately 100,000 self-employed, asking them to complete some pre-verification checks. So if you are a locum Optometrist or locum Dispensing Optician and started locuming post April 2019, this could be you.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong><u>What is included within this check?</u></strong></p>
          
          <p>These checks will be to confirm your identity and provide evidence of trade (or rather the lack of). We further understand that you will be given a link to a secure Dropbox, within which you will be required to upload a proof of your identity and three months worth of bank statements to demonstrate your trading level. Note this link will expire in 48 hours, so you must be prompt.</p>
          
          <p>Not all the newly self-employed will be contacted &ndash; if that is you, then you are advised to just wait for the opening of the application (sometime around mid-April).</p>

          <p>Letters of contacts are expected to arrive from 8 March until mid-April with follow up calls within 10 working days. &nbsp;The calls and letters will be carried out per the data you have provided HMRC on your last tax return. HMRC has informed us that it will make three attempts to phone. If HMRC is unsuccessful in reaching the taxpayer, they will write a further letter. Taxpayers who receive the letter but do not complete the checks will be unable to claim a grant. <strong>If you have changed numbers or address since then, please let HMRC know by calling 0800 024 1222. </strong></p>
          
          <p>An HMRC spokesperson said: &ldquo;We have moved quickly to ensure that we have the information we need from customers before applications are open- this is part of HMRC&rsquo;s overall efforts to help customers get support they are entitled to, whilst protecting the schemes from fraud.

          <p><span style="font-size:13px">Locumkit are proud to sponsor Vision Care for Homeless People for the Optoversity Challenge 2021.&nbsp;</span>Optometry students are gearing up for Out of the Box Optoversity Challenge, when they will test their knowledge against others in the same year group across the UK at the online event: Sunday 21<sup>st</sup> March.</p>
          
          <p>This popular annual challenge has already attracted entrants from all year groups with prizes generously donated by Keeler, Heine, Wolf Eyewear, Hoya, Lenstec, Norville, Topcon, Millmead, Alcon, Booth &amp; Bruce, Kirk &amp; Kirk, Jonny Goggles, ABDO, Scope and The Crazy Optom.</p>
          
          <p>The exciting challenge has a strong charity element to it with funds raised each year for Vision Care for Homeless People, through student sponsorship.&nbsp; As teams have already signed up from Anglia, Aston, Bradford, Cardiff, City, Glasgow, Lancashire, Manchester, Plymouth, Ulster and UWE the charity hopes it will be a bumper year for fundraising. Several optical suppliers (Altacor, Haag Steit, Visufarma, Locumkit and Ibis Vision) are sponsoring the event with funds going directly to the charity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Organised by <a href="http://www.outoftheboxoptics.co.uk">Out Of The Box Optics</a> this exciting event raised &pound;5,500 for the charity last year and in 2019 the sum was &pound;3,600.</p>
          
          <p>Harinder Paul, VCHP Trustee, is encouraging everyone to become involved &ndash;</p>
          
          <p>&ldquo;It is an exciting day and we are looking to draw the whole optical community together. Our terrific supporters have put up some great prizes for the best students &ndash; equipment and wonderful sunglasses, particularly.&rdquo;</p>
          
          <p>The day&rsquo;s challenges are likely to involve an ocular disease picture quiz, multiple choice questions, practical exams and anagrams to unscramble optical terminology. This year&rsquo;s Zoom event starts at 10-11.30am for year one students; Year 2 from 12-1.30pm and years 3 and 4 from 2-3.30pm.</p>
          
          <p>&ldquo;Everyone learns a lot at this event &ndash; particularly working to a deadline.&nbsp; There is still nearly a month to go so any more teams are welcome and any business wanting to support with sponsorship should get in touch,&rdquo; added Harinder. North London optom Karmelo Modina who created the event, in partnership with Gajan Singh, said &ldquo;Optoversity has proved to be a fantastic way to bring together optometry students and to help prepare them for working life in the best way possible.&rdquo;</p>

      array('title' => 'IR35 and its impact for us locums', 'slug' => 'ir35-impact-for-optics', 'description' => '<p>We keep hearing that IR35 will come into force from April 2021 - this is incorrect. IR35 has in fact been in force for a lot longer, however just in the public sector. Now it is being rolled out into the private sector; therefore Specsavers, Vision Express, and high street practices are now being affected by this, whereas our colleagues working say in hospitals must have already come across IR35.</p>
          
          <p>It is estimated that the impact of this could mean that locums could end up paying approximately 20-25% more in tax. In this article, I aim to breakdown what IR35 is and the impact it can have on us locums in Optometry.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>What is IR35 and why is it being implemented?</strong></p>
          
          <p>IR35 was first introduced in 2000 to reduce tax avoidance by contractors who HMRC believed to be &lsquo;disguised employees&rsquo; &ndash; people who work in a similar way to full-time employees but then invoice for their services via their limited companies to make their business as tax efficient as possible. HMRC plans to closely examine the de facto nature of the employer-contractor relationship, rather than relying on what is set out in the contract agreed by the two parties. If the intentions of the parties, as expressed in the contract, bear no resemblance to the real intentions of the parties, the written intentions will likely be ignored by HMRC. This refers to the principle of &lsquo;substance over form&rsquo; taking front seat in terms of how HMRC will assess going forward.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>What is happening from April 2021?</strong></p>
          
          <p>A lot of locums are slightly ill-informed that this is something new and HMRC have suddenly decided to clamp down on freelancers who work as pseudo employees - this is in fact not true. The change from April 2021 is purely that the onus of determining if a locum is under IR35 is on the employer, whilst historically it was on us locums to decide.</p>
          
          <p>So, from April 2021, your employer(s) will now be responsible for assessing whether contractors/locums working for them need to pay income tax and national insurance contributions.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>What does it mean to be inside / under IR35? </strong></p>
          
          <p>If you&rsquo;re deemed to be inside/under IR35 then HMRC sees you as a pseudo-employee of the company for tax purposes. This means you will be liable to pay the same PAYE tax as an ordinary full-time employee.</p>
          
          <p>A few locums have mentioned that the impact of IR35 does not affect them as they only locum for Independents; this is partially correct. IR35 is currently being rolled out to only medium to large clients. Independents do not fall under these remits. However, all this means is that those employers do not have the onus to determine your status, but that responsibility still lies with you to determine your employment status, which dictates whether you&rsquo;re an employee, a sole trader, or a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; which is somewhere in between the two.</p>
          
          <p>Note: Whilst we might think of each Specsavers, Vision Express (the big multiples) we work for are small individually as standalone branches/franchises, they are however medium to large as a group. The IR35 legislation applies to the parent (head) company based on the aggregate amount of turnover and the aggregate amount of the balance sheet total of the connected entities. So, all the individual stores are connected entities to make the one parent company.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>What makes IR35 so controversial?</strong></p>
          
          <p>Well there are quite a few points that make this such a hot topic for us locums:</p>
          
          <ul>
              <li>If we are deemed to fall within IR35, we are having to pay more taxes yet not benefit from employee benefits such as holidays, sick pay, etc.</li>
              <li>There is a concern that even if the rules of IR35 do not impact a particular employer (due to their small size i.e. independents), the employer may still take a risk-averse approach and qualify you as being inside IR35.</li>
              <li>The major point is that most employers have prepared for this by making you the locum take full ownership of this situation. If you look at your locum agreement with the respective employer, there is a good chance there is a point that states something along the lines of:</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>&ldquo;You declare that you are self-employed and that HMRC is aware of this status. If, however, HMRC deems you not to be self-employed and rather under IR35, then any additional taxes and penalties due, will be passed on to you, the locum&rdquo;</p>
          
          <p>With such clauses, the employers have tried to ring-fence themselves from any untoward HMRC investigations and any undesired consequences. Thus, you the locum are instead signing up towards transferring all associated responsibility and any consequences unto yourself. Can such a contractual clause be upheld in a court of law, it is too early to say.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>So how much worse off can a locum be if found to be under IR35</strong></p>
          
          <p>Assuming you locum 4 days a week, 48 weeks a year, have &pound;3,000 p.a allowable expenses, take a salary of &pound;12,000 p.a and all your work is under IR35 then you are estimated to be worse of by c&pound;7k if taking &pound;275 per day.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong>How will HMRC look to assess if I am in or out of IR35?</strong></p>
          
          <p>HMRC will look to examine your working practices to determine your IR35 status. Locums will need to ensure their contracts accurately reflect the working practices followed in their locum/contractor relationship. HMRC investigations are not confined to the contract you have in place with the employer but will examine the working practices you follow.</p>
          
          <p>Determining whether IR35 applies to your assignment is a complex matter. There are three key principles that will determine your IR35 status. We shall explain what these are here and bring in some previous cases which have gone to tribunal to highlight why the judge ruled for or against the contractor. As this is a new policy, there are still no set precedents and the fact that HMRC have lost cases in tribunal, highlights how confusing it really is to determine whether one is in or out of IR35. All advise given here is our opinion and understanding of the matter and we advise you to consult with an IR35 expert before taking any significant actions.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><strong><img alt="Supervision, Direction, Control IR35 Locumkit" src="/media/ckeditor-file/Supervision, Direction, Control IR35 Locumkit.png" style="float:left; height:107px; width:150px" /></strong><strong>Supervision, direction and control</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Does the client have much control to decide how you should carry out your work? If yes, means you are under IR35.</p>
          
          <p>This can be disputed at best, as you could argue that I carried out my pathology assessment via direct rather than indirect mechanism (Volk) or carried out the testing for pressures via contact tonometry and not NCT. Such practices demonstrate a level of autonomy in one&rsquo;s work that would differentiate a contractor from a permanent employee.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Substitution IR35 Locumkit" src="/media/ckeditor-file/Substitution IR35 Locumkit.png" style="float:left; height:107px; width:150px" /><strong>Substitution </strong>&ndash; Can you provide a substitute to go in place of you to the client? If yes, then you do not fall under the remit of IR35.</p>
          
          <p>One way to demonstrate you are indeed a business and not providing a personal service, it is recommended to have a clause within your contract that allows your company to provide a substitute in your absence.</p>
          
          <p>These clauses have been hotly debated in a series of employment status claims over the last few years, often with adverse results.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p><img alt="Mutuality of obligation IR35 Locumkit" src="/media/ckeditor-file/Mutuality of obligation IR35 Locumkit.JPG" style="float:left; height:107px; text-align:center; width:150px" /><strong>Mutuality of obligation:</strong>&nbsp;Is your client obliged to offer you work, and are you obliged to accept it?</p>
          
          <p>In layman terms, this means that you as a locum must be working client to client, with no obligation to carry on working for the client after the work is complete.</p>
          
          <p>A contractor also has the right to terminate a contract part-way through. An employee, on the other hand, can only work for one company and has an obligation to carry on working when their tasks are complete.</p>
          
          <p>You should also check whether the contract&nbsp;&nbsp;allows you to take on projects from other clients simultaneously, or whether the client can veto other assignments.</p>
          
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>In addition to the above, below there are some further considerations you should make, as these can ebb you in or out of IR35.</p>
          
          <p>Payment: An employee is expected to be paid at regular intervals, whereas a contractor will usually receive payment when work is completed. A contractor would invoice for the hours worked.</p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#0000FF">As locums we invoice our employers as and when we have worked a locum day. Other than Boots, our payments are made as and when the invoices have been approved and swept up under by specific payment runs, which are different to the regular monthly employee payroll run.</span></p>
          
          <p>Variety of work: Having variety of work with different employers is indicative you are a contractor and not an employee. An employee is usually obliged to have only one client at a time.</p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#0000FF">As locums we do work for a variety of different clients. If you have regular work and that is also for multiple days, then the lack of variety can work against you. Regular, guaranteed weekly or monthly work, specified in a contract, looks more like an employee &lsquo;contract of services&rsquo; rather than professional fees paid to a person who is self-employed. Variety is not seen on a week by week basis but on a period by period basis.</span></p>
          
          <p>Equipment/tools: A contractor is expected to bring their own equipment, rather than equipment supplied by your client.</p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#0000FF">As locum Optometrists we do bring our own volk, trial frame, Ophthalmoscope, Retinoscope, etc. Equipment up to the value of circa &pound;1.5k. However, there is an argument that whilst this is somewhat a material amount, it is insignificant when compared to the other machinery we use to such as OCT and a Fundus camera which cost circa &pound;30-50k each.</span></p>
          
          <p>Place of work: Your contract with the employer should state the location of where you are due to work.</p>
          
          <p>Financial risks: A contractor required to arrange their own professional indemnity insurance is indicative that you are acting as self-employed rather than an employee. If you cause a loss of business to the employer and rectify that, then it means that you are taking the financial risk, which a contractor would. As an employee, you are not responsible for making up the loss.</p>
          
          <p>Employee benefits: Benefits such as holiday, sick pay, workplace pension, GOC fees paid for are common things offered to employees and not to contractors.&nbsp;</p>
          
          <p>Part of the Company: A contractor should not become a part of the company&rsquo;s organisation. Things such as appearing on their organisation chart or appearing as a name on rotas compared to it stating &lsquo;locum&rsquo; can indicate you are part of the company.</p>
          
          <p><span style="color:#0000FF">Having been a locum I have seen staff rotas in the staff room, where they sometimes have regular locums referred to by their name, whereas ad-hoc locums are annotated as &lsquo;locum&rsquo;. As a locum you should distance yourself from the company&rsquo;s structure. When I was a resident, something that made me highly proud of my service was having clients wanting to see me for their recall examinations. As a locum, if you experience clients being booked in with you upon their request, this would perceive you to be part of the company. Your patients should be able to determine that you are a locum (temp cover) and therefore not a part of the inherent team, hence maybe as part of your introduction you could mention that you are the locum for the day and unable to facilitate a booking for return appointments with yourselves.</span></p>
