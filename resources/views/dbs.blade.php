                                        <p>If you are considering working as a locum, whether that be full or part time, there are a few things you need to have in order to ensure you are not falling foul of any rules and regulations:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Have indemnity insurance (most popular choice is the AOP)</li>
                                            <li>Have a DBS clearance certificate (your previous check is no longer valid once you leave employment)</li>
                                            <li>Register with locum agencies for locum bookings (Locumkit also acts as an agency but do not act as a middleman)</li>
                                            <li>Register with HMRC as a self-employed (Locumkit can help you with this &ndash; for more info click here)</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Disclosure and barring services (DBS), previously known as Criminal records Bureau (CRB) are in place to prevent unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups, including children. As
                                            Optometrists/Opticians you will likely encounter patients from vulnerable groups on a daily basis. Therefore you are required to have an enhanced criminal record check completed.</p>
                                        <p>An enhanced DBS check is the highest level of check available. Most roles within the healthcare industry require an enhanced DBS. At this level they will check cautions, warnings, reprimands, and
                                            convictions, as well as checking if the candidate is barred from working with children or vulnerable adults. It is a criminal offence for an Optometrist or Optician to work with these vulnerable
                                            groups if they are on the barred list.</p>
                                        <p>Locumkit can help you obtain your DBS clearance from as little as &pound;35.</p>

                                        <p>You will need to have the following information to apply:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Full name history</li>
                                            <li>Five-year address history with postcodes, including any foreign addresses</li>

                                        <p>Once you have provided all the relevant information you will be asked to submit your application. At this point you will receive a reference number and we at Locumkit will also get confirmation of

                                        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
                                        <p>Part of the DBS requirement is ID verification</p>
                                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p>The government require document verification to be conducted face to face. Therefore the best option we have found for our users is to go and visit the Post Office.</p>
                                        <p>We advise you to make photocopies of your documents and take them to the post office, along with the original documents for verification.</p>
                                        <p>You will need 3 ID documents to apply for your DBS check (see below a list of eligible documents). Most commonly used ID documents are passports, driving licences and bank statements. At least one of
                                            your documents will need to be for your current address. To find the closest post office to you that offers this service please click <a href="https://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder">here</a>.</p>
                                        <p>The post office will verify the originals against your persons and countersign on the photocopies to state:</p>
                                        <p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;I [Name] verify this is a true likeness of [Name] &ldquo; &ndash; Signed and dated.</p>
                                        <p>You will also need to obtain a verification form from them. The Post office will charge you &pound;12.50 for this service.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Note: Due to the COVID-19 situation, the government has relaxed these rules and we can verify your documentation via a video call. </strong></p>

                                        <p><strong>Q: Why do I need to get my documents verified?</strong></p>
                                        <p>A: The DBS check is the highest criminal records check in place and guidelines are very strict. Candidates who are cleared will be allowed to work with vulnerable groups and as such we need to ensure
                                            all documents are legitimate to eliminate fraud.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Q: How long does my certificate take?</strong></p>

                                            the longest part of the process is the police records search and this can vary by area.</p>
